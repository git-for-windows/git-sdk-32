# Converts named entities to character entities so they can be resolved without
# the use of external entity declarations. Primarily used for HTML documents.
#
# AsciiDoc documents often use named entities. However, XML defines only five
# named entities.
#
# This postprocessor reencodes most of the HTML 5 named entities into decimal
# entities so that they are valid in XML, HTML 4, and HTML 5. `&apos;` is not
# reencoded since named version is easier to read.
