NAME
----
git-refs - Low-level access to refs


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git refs migrate' --ref-format=<format> [--dry-run]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command provides low-level access to refs.

COMMANDS
--------

migrate::
	Migrate ref store between different formats.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are specific to 'git refs migrate':

--ref-format=<format>::
	The ref format to migrate the ref store to. Can be one of:
+
include::ref-storage-format.txt[]

--dry-run::
	Perform the migration, but do not modify the repository. The migrated
	refs will be written into a separate directory that can be inspected
	separately. The name of the directory will be reported on stdout. This
	can be used to double check that the migration works as expected before
	performing the actual migration.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------

The ref format migration has several known limitations in its current form:

* It is not possible to migrate repositories that have reflogs.

* It is not possible to migrate repositories that have worktrees.

* There is no way to block concurrent writes to the repository during an
  ongoing migration. Concurrent writes can lead to an inconsistent migrated
  state. Users are expected to block writes on a higher level. If your
  repository is registered for scheduled maintenance, it is recommended to
  unregister it first with git-maintenance(1).

These limitations may eventually be lifted.
