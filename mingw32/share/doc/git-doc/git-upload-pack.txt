git-upload-pack(1)
==================

NAME
----
git-upload-pack - Send objects packed back to git-fetch-pack


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git-upload-pack' [--[no-]strict] [--timeout=<n>] [--stateless-rpc]
		  [--advertise-refs] <directory>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Invoked by 'git fetch-pack', learns what
objects the other side is missing, and sends them after packing.

This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user.
The UI for the protocol is on the 'git fetch-pack' side, and the
program pair is meant to be used to pull updates from a remote
repository.  For push operations, see 'git send-pack'.

OPTIONS
-------

--[no-]strict::
	Do not try <directory>/.git/ if <directory> is no Git directory.

--timeout=<n>::
	Interrupt transfer after <n> seconds of inactivity.

--stateless-rpc::
	Perform only a single read-write cycle with stdin and stdout.
	This fits with the HTTP POST request processing model where
	a program may read the request, write a response, and must exit.

--http-backend-info-refs::
	Used by linkgit:git-http-backend[1] to serve up
	`$GIT_URL/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack` requests. See
	"Smart Clients" in linkgit:gitprotocol-http[5] and "HTTP
	Transport" in the linkgit:gitprotocol-v2[5]
	documentation. Also understood by
	linkgit:git-receive-pack[1].

<directory>::
	The repository to sync from.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

`GIT_PROTOCOL`::
	Internal variable used for handshaking the wire protocol. Server
	admins may need to configure some transports to allow this
	variable to be passed. See the discussion in linkgit:git[1].
