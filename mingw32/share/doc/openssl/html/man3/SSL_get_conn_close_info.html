<p>SSL_get_conn_close_info, SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_LOCAL, SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT - get information about why a QUIC connection was closed</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code>#include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

#define SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_LOCAL
#define SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT

typedef struct ssl_conn_close_info_st {
    uint64_t error_code, frame_type;
    char     *reason;
    size_t   reason_len;
    uint32_t flags;
} SSL_CONN_CLOSE_INFO;

int SSL_get_conn_close_info(SSL *ssl, SSL_CONN_CLOSE_INFO *info,
                            size_t info_len);</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The SSL_get_conn_close_info() function provides information about why and how a QUIC connection was closed.</p>

<p>Connection closure information is written to <i>*info</i>, which must be non-NULL. <i>info_len</i> must be set to <code>sizeof(*info)</code>.</p>

<p>The following fields are set:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="error_code"><i>error_code</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>This is a 62-bit QUIC error code. It is either a 62-bit application error code (if <b>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT</b> not set in <i>flags</i>) or a 62-bit standard QUIC transport error code (if <b>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT</b> is set in <i>flags</i>).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="frame_type"><i>frame_type</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>If <b>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT</b> is set, this may be set to a QUIC frame type number which caused the connection to be closed. It may also be set to 0 if no frame type was specified as causing the connection to be closed. If <b>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT</b> is not set, this is set to 0.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="reason"><i>reason</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>If non-NULL, this is intended to be a UTF-8 textual string briefly describing the reason for connection closure. The length of the reason string in bytes is given in <i>reason_len</i>. While, if non-NULL, OpenSSL guarantees that this string will be zero terminated, consider that this buffer may originate from the (untrusted) peer and thus may also contain zero bytes elsewhere. Therefore, use of <i>reason_len</i> is recommended.</p>

<p>While it is intended as per the QUIC protocol that this be a UTF-8 string, there is no guarantee that this is the case for strings received from the peer.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_LOCAL"><b>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_LOCAL</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>If <i>flags</i> has <b>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_LOCAL</b> set, connection closure was locally triggered. This could be due to an application request (e.g. if <b>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT</b> is unset), or (if <i>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT</i> is set) due to logic internal to the QUIC implementation (for example, if the peer engages in a protocol violation, or an idle timeout occurs).</p>

<p>If unset, connection closure was remotely triggered.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT"><b>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>If <i>flags</i> has <b>SSL_CONN_CLOSE_FLAG_TRANSPORT</b> set, connection closure was triggered for QUIC protocol reasons. Otherwise, connection closure was triggered by the local or remote application.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>SSL_get_conn_close_info() returns 1 on success and 0 on failure. This function fails if called on a QUIC connection SSL object which has not yet been terminated. It also fails if called on a QUIC stream SSL object or a non-QUIC SSL object.</p>
