Version 3.38.0 is a routine maintenance release of
SQLite.  There are various minor enhancements and
about a 0.5% reduction in the number of CPU cycles
used. See the
<a href="releaselog/3_38_0.html">release notes</a> for
more detail.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2022_01_06"></a><h3>2022-01-06 - <a href="releaselog/3_37_2.html">Version 3.37.2</a></h3><blockquote>
Version 3.37.2 fixes a
<a href="howtocorrupt.html#svptbug">database corruption bug</a>.  You are
encouraged to upgrade, especially if you are using <a href="lang_savepoint.html">SAVEPOINT</a>.</p>

<p>The problem first appeared in version 3.35.0 (2021-03-12) and
affects all subsequent releases through 3.37.1.
If temporary files are store in memory (which is not the default
behavior, but is sometimes selected by applications using either
<a href="compile.html#temp_store">-DSQLITE_TEMP_STORE</a> or <a href="pragma.html#pragma_temp_store">PRAGMA temp_store</a>) and
if a <a href="lang_savepoint.html">SAVEPOINT</a> is rolled back and then subsequent changes
within the same transaction are committed, the database file might
(with low but non-zero probability) go corrupt.

the UPSERT enhancements of <a href="releaselog/3_35_0.html">version 3.35.0</a>, that can cause
incorrect byte-code to be generated in some cases, resulting
in an infinite loop in the byte code, or a NULL-pointer dereference.
This patch release also fixes some other minor problems with
assert() statements and in the <a href="cli.html">CLI</a>.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_hat">Grey-hats</a> published
information about two SQLite bugs approximately 24 hours after
the release of version 3.32.0.  These bugs enable maliciously
crafted SQL to crash the process that is running SQLite.  Both
bugs are long-standing problems that affect releases prior to
3.32.0. The 3.32.1 release fixes both problems.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2020_05_22"></a><h3>2020-05-22 - Release 3.32.0</h3><blockquote>
Version 3.32.0 is an ordinary maintenance release of SQLite.
This release features the ability to run an
<a href="lang_analyze.html#approx">approximate ANALYZE</a> to gather database statistics for
use by the query planner, without having to scan every row
of every index.
See the <a href="releaselog/3_32_0.html">change log</a> for additional enhancements
and improvements.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2020_01_27"></a><h3>2020-01-27 - Release 3.31.1</h3><blockquote>
Applications that use SQLite should only interface with SQLite
through the officially published APIs.  Applications should not
depend upon or use the internal data structures of SQLite as those
structures might change from one release to another.  However, there
is a popular application that does depend on the details of the
internal layout of data in an internal SQLite data structure, and
those details changed in version 3.31.0, breaking the application.
This is, technically, a bug in the application, not in SQLite.
But it is within the power of SQLite to fix it, by reverting the
internal data structure change, and so that is what we have done
for the 3.31.1 release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2020_01_22"></a><h3>2020-01-22 - Release 3.31.0</h3><blockquote>
Version 3.31.0 is an ordinary maintenance release of SQLite.

</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2019_10_11"></a><h3>2019-10-11 - Release 3.30.1</h3><blockquote>
Version 3.30.1 is a bug-fix release that addresses a problem
that can occur when an aggregate function in a nested query
makes use of the new FILTER clause capability.  Some addition
patches for various obscure issues are also included, for
completeness.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2019_10_04"></a><h3>2019-10-04 - Release 3.30.0</h3><blockquote>
Version 3.30.0 is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
of SQLite containing miscellaneous performance and feature
enhancements.  This release adds support fo the NULLS FIRST
and NULLS LAST clauses on ORDER BY statements and the 
addition of FILTER clauses on all aggregate functions.
See the <a href="releaselog/3_30_0.html">change log</a> for details.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2019_07_10"></a><h3>2019-07-10 - Release 3.29.0</h3><blockquote>
Version 3.29.0 is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
of SQLite containing miscellaneous performance and feature
enhancements.  See the <a href="releaselog/3_29_0.html">change log</a> for
details.
<p>
Beginning with this release, the
<a href="quirks.html#dblquote">double-quoted string literal</a> misfeature is deprecated.
The misfeature is still enabled by default, for legacy
compatibility, however developers are encouraged to
disable it at compile-time using the
<a href="compile.html#dqs">-DSQLITE_DQS=0</a> option, or at run-time using
the <a href="c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigdqsdml">SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DQS_DML</a> and <a href="c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigdqsddl">SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DQS_DDL</a>
actions to the <a href="c3ref/db_config.html">sqlite3_db_config()</a> interface.  This is
especially true for double-quoted string literals in
CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX statements, as those elements
can cause unexpected problems following an ALTER TABLE.
See ticket <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9b78184be266fd70">9b78184be266fd70</a>
for an example.

Version 3.28.0 is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
of SQLite containing miscellaneous performance and feature
enhancements.  See the <a href="releaselog/3_28_0.html">change log</a> for
details.
<p>
This release fixes an obscure security issue. Applications
using older versions of SQLite may be vulnerable if
<ol>
<li> SQLite is compiled with certain optional extensions
     enabled, and
<li> the attacker is able to inject arbitrary SQL.
</ol>
We are not aware of any applications that are vulnerable to
this problem. On the other hand, we do not know about
every application that uses SQLite.  
If your application allows unauthenticated users on the internet
(and hence potential attackers) to run arbitrary SQL and if
you build SQLite with any of the optional extensions enabled,
then you should take this upgrade at your earliest opportunity.
<p>
For further information about improving SQLite's robustness
in internet-facing applications, see the our
<a href="security.html">security recommendations</a>.

Version 3.27.2 is a patch release that
fixes a two bugs and various documentation
errors found in the version 3.27.1.  The
changes from version 3.27.1 and 3.27.0 are
minimal.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2019_02_08"></a><h3>2019-02-08 - Release 3.27.1</h3><blockquote>
After release 3.27.0 was tagged, but before the build could
be completed and uploaded, a 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4e8e4857d32d401f">long-standing bug</a>
in the query optimizer was reported via System.Data.SQLite.
Since people will be upgrading anyhow, we decided 
publish the fix for this newly discovered problems right
away.  Hence, 3.27.1 was released less than 24 hours after
3.27.0.
<p>
It would have been better if the query optimizer bug had come to
our attention one day earlier, so that we could have incorporated
a fix into 3.27.0, but sometimes that's the way things go.

problems that have come to light and which seem serious enough to 
justify a patch.

SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_25_2.html">version 3.25.2</a> is another patch against 3.25.0 that fixes still
more problems associated with the new <a href="windowfunctions.html">window function</a> feature and the
<a href="lang_altertable.html">ALTER TABLE</a> enhancements.  Of particular note is the new
<a href="pragma.html#pragma_legacy_alter_table">PRAGMA legacy_alter_table=ON</a> command, which causes the ALTER TABLE RENAME
command to behave in the same goofy way that it did before the enhancements
found in version 3.25.0 &rarr; references to renamed tables that are inside
the bodies of triggers and views are not updated.  The legacy behavior is
arguably a bug, but some programs depend on the older buggy behavior.  The
3.25.2 release also contains a fix to <a href="windowfunctions.html">window function</a> processing for
VIEWs.  There also a slew of other minor fixes that affect obscure
compile-time options.  See the

two one-line fixes for bug that were introduced in version 3.25.0.
See the change log for details.  Upgrading from 3.25.0 is recommended.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2018_09_15"></a><h3>2018-09-15 - Release 3.25.0</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_25_0.html">version 3.25.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
Two big enhancements in this release:
<ol>
<li><p>
Support for <a href="windowfunctions.html">window functions</a> was added, using the PostgreSQL documentation
as the baseline.
<li><p>
The <a href="lang_altertable.html">ALTER TABLE</a> command was enhanced to support renaming of columns, and
so that column and table renames are propagated into trigger bodies and views.
</ol>
<p>In addition, there are various performance enhancements and minor fixes.
<p>One bug of note is 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9936b2fa443fec03ff25">ticket 9936b2fa443fec</a>
which describes a hard-to-reach condition where the ORDER BY LIMIT
optimization might cause an infinite loop during query evaluation.  
This ticket raised a lot of
concern on 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17964243">HackerNews</a> and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9ezy8c/serious_bug_causing_infinite_loop_in_some_queries/">Reddit</a>,
probably due to my choice of the ticket
title.  "Infinite Loop" sounds scary.  But I argue that the bug isn't really
all that bad in that it is very difficult to reach, will show up during
testing (rather than magically appearing after a product is
deployed), does not cause any data loss, and does not return an
incorrect result.  It was an important error, but not nearly as dire
as many people interpreted it to be.  And, in any event, it is fixed now.

<a href="releaselog/3_19_3.html">Version 3.19.3</a> is an emergency patch release to fix a 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/info/fda22108">bug</a> in 
<a href="pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum">auto_vacuum</a> logic that can lead to database corruption.
The bug was introduced in <a href="releaselog/3_16_0.html">version 3.16.0</a> 
(2017-01-02).  Though the bug is obscure and rarely
encountered, upgrading is recommended for all users, and
especially for users who turn on <a href="pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum">auto_vacuum</a>.

Still more problems have been found in the LEFT JOIN
<a href="https://sqlite.org/optoverview.html#flattening">flattening</a> optimization
that was added in the 3.19.0 release.  This patch release fixes all known
issues with that optimization and adds new test cases.  Hopefully this
will be the last patch.

One of the new query planner optimizations in the 3.19.0 release contained
bugs.  The 3.19.1 patch release fixes them.
<p>
Beginning with 3.19.0, subqueries and views on the right-hand side of
a LEFT JOIN operator could sometimes be
<a href="https://sqlite.org/optoverview.html#flattening">flattened</a> into the
main query.  The new optimization worked well for all of the test cases
that the developers devised, and for millions of legacy test cases, but
once 3.19.0 was released, users found some other cases where the optimization
failed.  Ticket
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/info/cad1ab4cb7b0fc344">cad1ab4cb7b0fc344</a> contains
examples.
<p>
These problems exist only in 3.19.0.  Users of SQLite 3.19.0 should
upgrade, but users of all prior versions of SQLite are safe.

SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_19_0.html">version 3.19.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
<p>
The emphasis on this release is improvements to the query planner.
There are also some obscure bug fixes.  There is no reason to upgrade
unless you are having problems with a prior release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2017_03_30"></a><h3>2017-03-30 - Release 3.18.0</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_18_0.html">version 3.18.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
<p>
This release features an initial implementation the 
"<a href="pragma.html#pragma_optimize">PRAGMA optimize</a>" command.  This command can now be used to cause
<a href="lang_analyze.html">ANALYZE</a> to be run on an as-needed basis.  Applications should invoke
"PRAGMA optimize" just before closing the <a href="c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a>.
The "PRAGMA optimize" statement will likely be enhanced to do other
kinds of automated database maintenance in future releases.
<p>
The <a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a> version control system that is
used to manage the SQLite project has been upgraded to use SHA3-256 hashes
instead of SHA1.  Therefore, the version identifications for SQLite now
show a 64-hex-digit SHA3-256 hash rather than the 40-hex-digit SHA1 hash.
<p>
See the <a href="releaselog/3_18_0.html">change log</a> for other enhancements and optimizations
in this release.

SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_17_0.html">version 3.17.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
<p>
Most of the changes in this release are performance optimizations.
Optimizations to the <a href="rtree.html">R-Tree extension</a> are especially noticeable.
<p>
In this release, the default size of the 
<a href="malloc.html#lookaside">lookaside buffer</a> allocated for each database connection
is increased from 64,000 to 120,000 bytes.  This provides improved
performance on many common workloads in exchange for a small increase
in memory usage.
Applications that value a small memory footprint over raw speed
can change the lookaside buffer size back to its old value (or to zero)
using the <a href="compile.html#default_lookaside">SQLITE_DEFAULT_LOOKASIDE</a> compile-time option, or the
<a href="c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfiglookaside">sqlite3_config(SQLITE_CONFIG_LOOKASIDE)</a>
start-time setting, or the
<a href="c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfiglookaside">sqlite3_db_config(SQLITE_DBCONFIG_LOOKASIDE)</a>
run-time setting.

SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_16_1.html">version 3.16.1</a> fixes a bug in the row-value logic for UPDATE
statements inside of triggers.  The bug has been there since row-values
were added by release 3.15.0, but was not discovered until just a few
minutes after the 3.16.0 release was published, and so it was not fixed
by 3.16.0.  This patch release is version 3.16.0 with the row-value bug fix.

SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_15_0.html">version 3.15.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
The key feature in this release is the added support for
<a href="rowvalue.html">row values</a>.  There are also other enhancements and
fixes for a number of obscure bugs.
<p>
The 3.15.0 release uses about 7% fewer CPU cycles than 3.14.2.
Most of the improvement in this release
is in the SQL parser, query planner, and
byte-code generator (the front-end) corresponding
to the <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v2()</a> interface.  Overall,
version 3.15.0 uses about half as much CPU time as
version 3.8.1 (2013-10-17).  These
performance measurements are made using the "speedtest1.c"
workload on x64 compiled with gcc and -Os. Performance
improvements may vary with different platforms and
workloads.

<p>Yikes!  The 3.12.0 and 3.12.1 releases contain a backwards compatibility bug!
   Tables that declare a column with type <tt>"INTEGER" PRIMARY KEY</tt>
   (where the datatype name INTEGER is quoted) generate an incompatible
   database file.  The mistake came about because the developers have never
   thought to put a typename in quotes before, and so there was no documentation 
   of that capability nor any tests.  (There are tests now, though, of course.)
   Instances of quoting the datatype name are probably infrequent in the wild,
   so we do not expect the impact of this bug to be too severe.
   Upgrading is still strongly recommended.
<p>Fixes for three other minor issues were included in this patch release.
   The other issues would have normally been deferred until the next scheduled
   release, but since a patch release is being issued anyhow, they might as
   well be included.
