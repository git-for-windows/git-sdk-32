<h1 id="executive_summary"><span>1. </span>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>SQLite works by translating SQL statements into bytecode and
then running that bytecode in a virtual machine.  This document
describes how how the bytecode engine works.

</p><p>This document describes SQLite internals.  The information provided
here is not needed for routine application development using SQLite.
This document is intended for people who want to delve more deeply into
the internal operation of SQLite.

</p><p>The bytecode engine is <u>not</u> an API of SQLite.  Details
about the bytecode engine change from one release of SQLite to the next.
Applications that use SQLite should not depend on any of the details
found in this document.



</p><h1 id="introduction"><span>2. </span>Introduction</h1>

<p>SQLite works by translating each SQL statement into bytecode and
then running that bytecode.
A <a href="c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statement</a> in SQLite is mostly just the bytecode needed to
implement the corresponding SQL.  The <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v2()</a> interface
is a compiler that translates SQL into bytecode.
The <a href="c3ref/step.html">sqlite3_step()</a> interface is the virtual machine that runs the
bytecode contained within the <a href="c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statement</a>.

</p><p>The bytecode virtual machine is the heart of SQLite.
Programmers who want to understand how SQLite operates internally
must be familiar with the bytecode engine.

</p><p>Historically, the bytecode engine in SQLite is called the
"Virtual DataBase Engine" or "VDBE".  This website uses the terms
"bytecode engine", "VDBE", "virtual machine", and "bytecode virtual
machine" interchangeably, as they all mean the same thing.

</p><p>
This article also uses the terms "bytecode program" and
"prepared statement" interchangeably, as they are mostly the same thing.

</p><h2 id="vdbe_source_code"><span>2.1. </span>VDBE Source Code</h2>

<p>The source code to the bytecode engine is in the 
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbe.c">vdbe.c</a> source
file.  The <a href="opcode.html#codes">opcode definitions</a> in this document are derived
from comments in that source file. The 
source code comments are the canonical source of information
about the bytecode engine.  When in doubt, refer to the source code.</p>

<p>In addition to the primary vdbe.c source code file, there are 
other helper code files in the source tree, all of whose names
begin with "vdbe" - short for "Virtual DataBase Engine".

</p><p>Remember that the names and meanings of opcodes often change from
one release of SQLite to the next.  So if you are studying the <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a>
output from SQLite, you should reference the version of this document
(or the vdbe.c source code)
that corresponds to the version of SQLite that ran the <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a>.
Otherwise, the description of the opcodes may not be accurate.
This document is derived from SQLite
 version 3.38.0 check-in
<a href='https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?c=40fa792d359f8'>40fa792d359f8</a> dated 2022-02-22.




</p><h2 id="instruction_format"><span>2.2. </span>Instruction Format</h2>


<p>A bytecoded program in SQLite consists of one or more instructions.
Each instruction has an opcode and
five operands named P1, P2  P3, P4, and P5.  The P1, P2, and P3 
operands are 32-bit signed integers.  These operands often refer to 
registers.  For instructions that operate on b-tree cursors,
the P1 operand is usually the cursor number.
For jump instructions, P2 is usually the jump destination.
P4 may be a 32-bit signed integer, a 64-bit signed integer, a
64-bit floating point value, a string literal, a Blob literal,
a pointer to a collating sequence comparison function, or a
pointer to the implementation of an application-defined SQL
function, or various other things.  P5 is an 16-bit unsigned integer
normally used to hold flags.  Bits of the P5 flag can sometimes affect
the opcode in subtle ways.  For example, if the 
SQLITE_NULLEQ (0x0080) bit of the P5 operand
is set on the <a href="opcode.html#Eq">Eq</a> opcode, then the NULL values compare
equal to one another.  Otherwise NULL values compare different
from one another.


<p>Some opcodes use all five operands.  Some opcodes use
one or two.  Some opcodes use none of the operands.</p><p>


<p>The bytecode engine begins execution on instruction number 0.
Execution continues until a <a href="opcode.html#Halt">Halt</a> instruction is seen, or until
the program counter becomes greater than the address of
last instruction, or until there is an error.
When the bytecode engine halts, all memory
that it allocated is released and all database cursors it may
have had open are closed.  If the execution stopped due to an
error, any pending transactions are terminated and changes made
to the database are rolled back.</p>



<p>The <a href="opcode.html#ResultRow">ResultRow</a> opcode causes the
bytecode engine to pause and the corresponding <a href="c3ref/step.html">sqlite3_step()</a>
call to return <a href="rescode.html#row">SQLITE_ROW</a>.  Before invoking
<a href="opcode.html#ResultRow">ResultRow</a>, the bytecoded program will
have loaded the results for a single row of a query into a series
of registers.  C-language APIs such as <a href="c3ref/column_blob.html">sqlite3_column_int()</a>
or <a href="c3ref/column_blob.html">sqlite3_column_text()</a> extract the query results from those
registers.  The bytecode engine resumes with the next instruction
after the <a href="opcode.html#ResultRow">ResultRow</a> on the next call
to <a href="c3ref/step.html">sqlite3_step()</a>.


</p><h2 id="registers"><span>2.3. </span>Registers</h2>


<p>Every bytecode program has a fixed (but potentially large) number of
registers.  A single register can hold a variety of objects:
<ul>
<li> A NULL value
<li> A signed 64-bit integer
<li> An IEEE double-precision (64-bit) floating point number
<li> An arbitrary length strings
<li> An arbitrary length BLOB
<li> A RowSet object (See the <a href="opcode.html#RowSetAdd">RowSetAdd</a>, <a href="opcode.html#RowSetRead">RowSetRead</a>, and
                      <a href="opcode.html#RowSetTest">RowSetTest</a> opcodes)
<li> A Frame object (Used by <a href="opcode.html#subprog">subprograms</a> - see <a href="opcode.html#Program">Program</a>)
</ul>


<p>A register can also be "Undefined" meaning that it holds no value
at all.  Undefined is different from NULL.  Depending on compile-time
options, an attempt to read an undefined register will usually cause
a run-time error.  If the code generator (<a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v2()</a>)
ever generates a <a href="c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statement</a> that reads an Undefined register,
that is a bug in the code generator.

</p><p>
Registers are numbered beginning with 0.
Most opcodes refer to at least one register.

</p><p>The number of registers in a single prepared statement is fixed
at compile-time.  The content of all registers is cleared when
a prepared statement is <a href="c3ref/reset.html">reset</a> or
<a href="c3ref/finalize.html">finalized</a>.

</p><p>The internal Mem object stores the value for a single register.
The abstract <a href="c3ref/value.html">sqlite3_value</a> object that is exposed in the API is really
just a Mem object or register.

</p><h2 id="b_tree_cursors"><span>2.4. </span>B-Tree Cursors</h2>


<p>A prepared statement can have
zero or more open cursors.  Each cursor is identified by a
small integer, which is usually the P1 parameter to the opcode
that uses the cursor.
There can be multiple cursors open on the same index or table.
All cursors operate independently, even cursors pointing to the same
indices or tables.
The only way for the virtual machine to interact with a database
file is through a cursor.
Instructions in the virtual machine can create a new cursor 
(ex: <a href="opcode.html#OpenRead">OpenRead</a> or <a href="opcode.html#OpenWrite">OpenWrite</a>),
read data from a cursor (<a href="opcode.html#Column">Column</a>),
advance the cursor to the next entry in the table
(ex: <a href="opcode.html#Next">Next</a> or <a href="opcode.html#Prev">Prev</a>), and so forth.
All cursors are automatically
closed when the prepared statement is <a href="c3ref/reset.html">reset</a> or
<a href="c3ref/finalize.html">finalized</a>.


<a name="subprog"></a>

<h2 id="subroutines_coroutines_and_subprograms"><span>2.5. </span>Subroutines, Coroutines, and Subprograms</h2>

<p>The bytecode engine has no stack on which to store the return address
of a subroutine.  Return addresses must be stored in registers.
Hence, bytecode subroutines are not reentrant.


<p>The <a href="opcode.html#Gosub">Gosub</a> opcode stores the current program counter into
register P1 then jumps to address P2.  The <a href="opcode.html#Return">Return</a> opcode jumps
to address P1+1.  Hence, every subroutine is associated with two integers:
the address of the entry point in the subroutine and the register number
that is used to hold the return address.

<p>The <a href="opcode.html#Yield">Yield</a> opcode swaps the value of the program counter with
the integer value in register P1.  This opcode is used to implement
coroutines.  Coroutines are often used to implement subqueries from
which content is pulled on an as-needed basis.


</p><p><a href="lang_createtrigger.html">Triggers</a> need to be reentrant.


Since bytecode
subroutines are not reentrant a different mechanism must be used to
implement triggers.  Each trigger is implemented using a separate bytecode
program with its own opcodes, program counter, and register set.  The
<a href="opcode.html#Program">Program</a> opcode invokes the trigger subprogram.  The <a href="opcode.html#Program">Program</a> instruction
allocates and initializes a fresh register set for each invocation of the
subprogram, so subprograms can be reentrant and recursive.  The
<a href="opcode.html#Param">Param</a> opcode is used by subprograms to access content in registers
of the calling bytecode program.


</p><h2 id="self_altering_code"><span>2.6. </span>Self-Altering Code</h2>


<p>Some opcodes are self-altering.
For example, the <a href="opcode.html#Init">Init</a> opcode (which is always the first opcode
in every bytecode program) increments its P1 operand.  Subsequent
<a href="opcode.html#Once">Once</a> opcodes compare their P1 operands to the P1 value for
the <a href="opcode.html#Init">Init</a> opcode in order to determine if the one-time initialization
code that follows should be skipped.
Another example is the <a href="opcode.html#String8">String8</a> opcode which converts its P4
operand from UTF-8 into the correct database string encoding, then
converts itself into a <a href="opcode.html#String">String</a> opcode.



<h1 id="viewing_the_bytecode"><span>3. </span>Viewing The Bytecode</h1>

<p>Every SQL statement that SQLite interprets results in a program
for the virtual machine.  But if the SQL statement begins with
the keyword <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a> the virtual machine will not execute the
program.  Instead, the instructions of the program will be returned,
one instruction per row,
like a query result.  This feature is useful for debugging and
for learning how the virtual machine operates.  For example:
</p>

<p>Any application can run an <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a> query to get output similar to 
the above.
However, indentation to show the loop structure is not generated
by the SQLite core.  The <a href="cli.html">command-line shell</a> contains extra logic
for indenting loops.
Also, the "comment" column in the <a href="lang_explain.html">EXPLAIN</a> output
is only provided if SQLite is compiled with the
<a href="compile.html#enable_explain_comments">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_EXPLAIN_COMMENTS</a> options.

</p><p>When SQLite is compiled with the <a href="compile.html#debug">SQLITE_DEBUG</a> compile-time option,
extra <a href="pragma.html#syntax">PRAGMA</a> commands are available that are useful for debugging and
for exploring the operation of the VDBE.  For example the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_trace">vdbe_trace</a>
pragma can be enabled to cause a disassembly of each VDBE opcode to be
printed on standard output as the opcode is executed.  These debugging
pragmas include:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="pragma.html#pragma_parser_trace">PRAGMA parser_trace</a>
</li><li> <a href="pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_addoptrace">PRAGMA vdbe_addoptrace</a>

<p>A value of N in the seekHit flag of cursor P1 means that there exists
a key P3:N that will match some record in the index.  We want to know
if it is possible for a record P3:P4 to match some record in the

is less than P4, attempt to find out if a match is possible by running
<a href="opcode.html#NotFound">NotFound</a>.</p>

<p>This opcode is used in IN clause processing for a multi-column key.
If an IN clause is attached to an element of the key other than the
left-most element, and if there are no matches on the most recent
seek over the whole key, then it might be that one of the key element
to the left is prohibiting a match, and hence there is "no hope" of
any match regardless of how many IN clause elements are checked.
In such a case, we abandon the IN clause search early, using this
opcode.  The opcode name comes from the fact that the
jump is taken if there is "no hope" of achieving a match.</p>

does contain an entry whose prefix matches the P3/P4 record then control
falls through to the next instruction and P1 is left pointing at the
matching entry.</p>

advanced in either direction.  In other words, the <a href="opcode.html#Next">Next</a> and <a href="opcode.html#Prev">Prev</a>
