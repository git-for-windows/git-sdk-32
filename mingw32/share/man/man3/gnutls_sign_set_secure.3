.SH NAME
gnutls_sign_set_secure \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_sign_set_secure(gnutls_sign_algorithm_t " sign ", unsigned int " secure ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_sign_algorithm_t sign" 12
the sign algorithm
.IP "unsigned int secure" 12
whether to mark the sign algorithm secure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Modify the previous system wide setting that marked  \fIsign\fP as secure
or insecure.  Calling this function is allowed
only if allowlisting mode is set in the configuration file,
and only if the system\-wide TLS priority string
has not been initialized yet.
The intended usage is to provide applications with a way
to expressly deviate from the distribution or site defaults
inherited from the configuration file.
The modification is composable with further modifications
performed through the priority string mechanism.

This function is not thread\-safe and is intended to be called
in the main thread at the beginning of the process execution.

Even when  \fIsecure\fP is true,  \fIsign\fP is not marked as secure for the
use in certificates.  Use \fBgnutls_sign_set_secure_for_certs()\fP to
mark it secure as well for certificates.
.SH "RETURNS"
0 on success or negative error code otherwise.
.SH "SINCE"
3.7.3
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
