;; Compared to Andrew K. Wright's `match', this one lacks `match-define',
;; `match:error-control', `match:set-error-control', `match:error',
;; `match:set-error', and all structure-related procedures.  Also,
;; `match' doesn't support clauses of the form `(pat => exp)'.

;; Unmodified public domain code by Alex Shinn retrieved from
;; the Chibi-Scheme repository, commit 1206:acd808700e91.

;; Note: Make sure to update `match.test.upstream' when updating this
