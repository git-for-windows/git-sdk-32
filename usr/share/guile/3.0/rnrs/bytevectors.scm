;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; A "bytevector" is a raw bit string.  This module provides procedures to
;;; manipulate bytevectors and interpret their contents in a number of ways:
;;; bytevector contents can be accessed as signed or unsigned integer of
;;; various sizes and endianness, as IEEE-754 floating point numbers, or as
;;; strings.  It is a useful tool to decode binary data.
