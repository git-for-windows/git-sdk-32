;;; Commentary:

;; This is a convenience module providing SRFI-88 "keyword object".  All it
;; does is setup the right reader option and export keyword-related
;; convenience procedures.

;;; Code:

(define-module (srfi srfi-88)
  #:re-export (keyword?)
  #:export (keyword->string string->keyword))

(cond-expand-provide (current-module) '(srfi-88))


;; Change the keyword syntax both at compile time and run time; the latter is
;; useful at the REPL.
(eval-when (expand load eval)
  (read-set! keywords 'postfix))

(define (keyword->string k)
  "Return the name of @var{k} as a string."
  (symbol->string (keyword->symbol k)))

(define (string->keyword s)
  "Return the keyword object whose name is @var{s}."
  (symbol->keyword (string->symbol s)))

;;; Local Variables:
