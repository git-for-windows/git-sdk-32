=head1 NAME

perl5343delta - what is new for perl v5.34.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.34.1 release and the 5.34.3
release.  B<Please note:> This document ignores Perl 5.34.2, a broken release
which existed for a couple of days only.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.34.0, first read
L<perl5341delta>, which describes differences between 5.34.0 and 5.34.1.

=head1 Security

This release fixes the following security issues.

=head2 CVE-2023-47038 - Write past buffer end via illegal user-defined Unicode property

This vulnerability was reported directly to the Perl security team by
Nathan Mills C<the.true.nathan.mills@gmail.com>.

A crafted regular expression when compiled by perl 5.30.0 through
5.38.0 can cause a one-byte attacker controlled buffer overflow in a
heap allocated buffer.

=head2 CVE-2023-47039 - Perl for Windows binary hijacking vulnerability

This vulnerability was reported to the Intel Product Security Incident
Response Team (PSIRT) by GitHub user ycdxsb
L<https://github.com/ycdxsb/WindowsPrivilegeEscalation>. PSIRT then
reported it to the Perl security team.

Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to
find the shell (C<cmd.exe>). When running an executable which uses
Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute C<cmd.exe>
within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues,
Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory.

An attacker with limited privileges can exploit this behavior by
placing C<cmd.exe> in locations with weak permissions, such as
C<C:\ProgramData>. By doing so, when an administrator attempts to use
this executable from these compromised locations, arbitrary code can
be executed.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.
